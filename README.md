# Data-Mining-Project
A project from my graduate school coursework that involved data mining, machine learning and exploratory data analysis.

This analysis looks at labor demographic survey data in the United States from the 2019 Current Population Survey (CPS) of the United States Census.
The objective of this research was to use several machine learning models to predict four key variables that were identified as wages, gender, employment, and geography.
For each of these variables I construct five different machine learning models that are as follows: logistic regression, logistic regression with cross-validation, K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and Decision Trees.
After interpreting the results of each I look at the accuracy, precision, recall rate, F1 score, and runtime performance measurements to determine which model had the best fit for predicting the variable in question.
The code also produces area under the curve (AUC) and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) to check the classification modelâ€™s performance metrics.
Summary and descriptive statistics of the relevant variables, as well as several data visualization plots are also created.
